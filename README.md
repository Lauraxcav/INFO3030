# INFO3030
Advanced Java 2019 w/ SMarks

This is a readme file.  I don't know if I need a new repository for each assignment, or what.  This is a "hello-world" project to lear how to use Git.
I'ave never used Git, although I have used source code control with VB (sweet), and InterSystems Cache (We use 3rd party called Deltanji 0 useful).

Please help.
