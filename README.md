Advanced Java 2019 w/ SMarks

This is a readme file.  I don't know if I need a new repository for each assignment, or what.  This is a "hello-world" project to learn how to use Git.
I've never used Git, although I have used source code control with VB (sweet), and InterSystems Cache (We use a 3rd party called Deltanji - useful).

Please help. I don't know what the client for Git is used for.  Perhaps that's where my java code will live -- on my laptop? -- and then I can pull it up or something.  I just don't know.  I'm too old for this! No, I jest.
